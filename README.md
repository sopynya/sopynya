# Hello!! Welcome to my profile ꉂ(˵˃ ᗜ ˂˵)

> Quietly crafting projects and dreaming about what comes next.

## About Me

I’ve been curious about how technology works since I was young, and coding became a natural path for me. I enjoy scientific ideas, structured databases, and writing code with careful attention to detail.


I’m most experienced as a front-end developer, but I also enjoy working across full-stack and backend when I can design systems that are clear and well-organized. I’m always learning, experimenting, and building with intention.

## What I Know

List the tools, languages, and technologies you feel comfortable with.\
You can organize them like this:

-   Languages: JS, python, HTML, css, TS
-   Frameworks / Libraries: React, Next, Nest, express
-   Databases: PostgreSQL, mongoDB, mySQL
-   Tools / Other: Git & GitHub, Node.js, REST/JSON APIs, VS Code, Neon, Baas (e.g., supabase), basic deployment (e.g., Vercel)

## What I'm Exploring Next

I'm focused on getting deeper into backend coding (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)

## Things I Enjoy

I like games, cute things, dinosaurs, cats, aquatic creatures and the nature in general.\
My favorite dinosaur is the Triceratops. ✶⋆.˚
